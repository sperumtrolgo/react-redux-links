# What is a 3skeng transaction key and how to use it?
 
3skeng is a 3D engineering software for Trimble SketchUp that allows you to design and document MEP and 3D piping and steel structures[^3^]. If you want to use 3skeng, you need to purchase a license for the tool or library that you need. There are different ways to buy 3skeng licenses, such as using the integrated shop, buying by invoice, or buying through resellers[^2^].

A 3skeng transaction key is a code that you receive when you buy a license by invoice or through resellers. It is a unique identifier that links your purchase to your account. You need to enter the transaction key in the 3skeng client to activate your license. To do that, follow these steps:
 
1. Open SketchUp and go to Extensions > 3skeng > License Manager.
2. Click on the "Add License" button and select "Transaction Key".
3. Enter your transaction key in the field and click "OK".
4. Synchronize 3skeng and restart SketchUp.

You can now use your 3skeng license for one year after purchase. You can check your license status and expiration date in the License Manager. If you have any questions or issues regarding 3skeng licenses, please contact support@3skeng.com[^2^].
