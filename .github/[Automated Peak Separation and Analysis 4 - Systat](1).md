PeakFit 412 is a software application that can automatically fit data to various peak models, such as Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt, Pearson and more. PeakFit 412 can also perform data smoothing, baseline correction, peak integration and quantification, and statistical analysis. PeakFit 412 is designed for spectroscopy, chromatography, electrophoresis and other fields that require accurate detection, separation and quantification of hidden peaks[^1^] [^3^].

PeakFit 412 uses three methods for automatic positioning of peaks: residual method, second derivative method and deconvolution method. In the residual method, the peak is placed by finding the maximum relative in the continuous flow of the data. The second derivative method looks for the relative minimum in the neighborhood where the second derivative is zero. The deconvolution method uses a fast Fourier transform to separate overlapping peaks[^1^]. PeakFit 412 also allows users to input specific parameters and constraints to simulate peak data under different conditions[^2^].
 
PeakFit 412 supports multiple file formats for input data, such as Quattro Pro, Lotus 123, ASCII and Excel. It also provides various options for output data, such as graphs, tables, reports and exports. PeakFit 412 has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to use and customize. PeakFit 412 is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11 operating systems[^1^].
